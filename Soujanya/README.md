## Half Day 1
On day one of this week, I happened to create a draft of the presentation with the specifications document. I could clear some of my doubts, also got my work reviewed by professor. I don’t have much to show in the commits but all that I had worked was reviewing the RFP and listing on the points required to client’s presentation. Also, updating some of the meeting minutes.

## Half Day 2
On Wednesday 09/02/2020 – As a Team Lead, my major contribution for this whole week had gone in preparing the presentation for clients meeting. I had made the presentation document ready, as part of the meeting I gathered the Requirements, Project Development Specifications, and the outcomes to show. Also the previous day we had a small change in terms of schedule and cost estimation, which made us to re-evaluate of the efforts and timelines. Also the team had a zoom call discussing on the roles and few specific updates on the Work Breakdown chart.
