# Individual Contribution

## Attendance
- I had attended GDP-1 classes in-person on 21st, 26th and 28th of August 2020.
- I have been collaborating with the team over calls and meetings regarding the proposal and planning all the while.
## Half Day 1
A day before the in-person class I had gone through the RFP provided by Prof. Charles Badami, and we had a client meeting with Dr. Rhonda Beemer. We brainstormed in the class regarding the clientâ€™s requirement and understood the goals of the project.
