# Individual Contribution

## Attendance
- I had attended GDP-1 classes in-person on 21st, 26th and 28th of August 2020.
- I have been collaborating with the team over calls and meetings regarding the proposal and planning all the while.
## Half Day 1
A day before the in-person class I had gone through the RFP provided by Prof. Charles Badami, and we had a client meeting with Dr. Rhonda Beemer. We brainstormed in the class regarding the client’s requirement and understood the goals of the project.
Questions & Answers discussed:
-	Who are the target audience for this application, any specific set of age groups
-	Do we have phases?
    * Initially to get started with the application where the user could manually inset the data,
    * In the upcoming phase where we build a device that could auto read the user data.
-	Do we gather users information such as age, weight, height to calculate the BMI of individuals
-	How will the analytics be showed, is it in the form of graphs?
-	Do we provide any service fitness suggestions?
-	Are we providing a team of qualified diet/ fitness expert’s available in-app
