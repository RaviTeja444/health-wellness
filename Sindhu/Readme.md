# Half Day 1
On the first day, I have listened to client about Request For Proposal and requirements by client and professor in the client meeting.
I have joined the collaborative repo in github.
Later, we had a meeting and discussed about our application's use from user's perspective.
We assigned roles and divided the work among ourselves and started working on the application.
